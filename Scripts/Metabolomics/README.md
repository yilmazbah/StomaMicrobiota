Ions were annotated based on accurate mass comparison using 3mDa mass tolerance against unique molecular weights of compounds present in the Human Metabolome Database (Wishart et al., 2013). The adj-p-values-value < 0.05 and absolute fold change (log2) > 2 were calculated from quantile-normalized ion counts using Matlab R2020b and used as a cut-off parameter for visualization. One-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s HSD test was used to test the significance of metabolite differences between intestinal locations. Quantile-normalized ion counts were z-score transformed for k-means clustering, and the appropriate number of 10 clusters was determined based on the mean sum of point to centroid distances.. No new code was developed in this study.
